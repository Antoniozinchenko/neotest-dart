## Status:

**Work in progress ðŸš§**.

## Installation

Using packer:

```lua
use({
  'nvim-neotest/neotest',
  requires = {
    ...,
    'sidlatau/neotest-dart',
  }
  config = function()
    require('neotest').setup({
      ...,
      adapters = {
        require('neotest-dart') {
             fvm = false, -- takes priority over path, uses <workspace>/.fvm/flutter_sdk if enabled
          },
      }
    })
  end
})
```

## Usage

_NOTE_: all usages of `require('neotest').run.run` can be mapped to a command in your config (this is not included and should be done by the user)

#### Test single function

To test a single test hover over the test and run `require('neotest').run.run()`

#### Test file

To test a file run `require('neotest').run.run(vim.fn.expand('%'))`
